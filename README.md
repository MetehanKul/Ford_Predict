# Ford Vehicle Price Prediction Project

## Project Description
This project aims to predict the prices of Ford vehicles based on historical data. It enables users to input vehicle information and receive accurate price estimates, allowing them to make more informed decisions when purchasing a vehicle.

## Project Overview
To achieve this goal, I analyzed historical data and identified price determination trends. I cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure its quality and consistency. Then, I employed various statistical models to obtain accurate predictions of vehicle prices.

The project includes the following steps:
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature engineering
4. Model selection and training
5. User-friendly simple interface
6. Model evaluation and selection of the best performing model
7. Forecasting future vehicle prices and generating predictions

## Results
My analysis and modeling efforts enabled me to obtain accurate price predictions based on the vehicle information provided by users. By identifying trends in the data, I was able to determine which models were most suitable and enhance prediction performance.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the potential for predicting Ford vehicle prices. I hope my work serves as a better guide for users in their vehicle purchasing decisions.
